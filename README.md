SBA 3: Design and Development – Bento Grid (Bootstrap)

Overview

This project is part of my Per Scholas Software Engineering (MERN Stack) training.
For this SBA, I completed the Bento Grid challenge from Frontend Mentor using Bootstrap 5 and a bit of custom CSS.
The goal was to take a given design and turn it into a responsive, working webpage.

My Approach

I started by setting up folders for HTML, CSS, and images.
Then, I used Bootstrap’s grid system to build a flexible layout that works across different screen sizes.
I added cards, buttons, and utility classes for spacing, colors, and text.
I kept my custom CSS minimal—mainly for background colors and rounded corners.

The layout adjusts smoothly on mobile, tablet, and desktop.
I focused on keeping my code clean, simple, and easy to follow.

Reflection

At first, I was a bit confused between Tailwind and Bootstrap, but with practice, I became more confident using Bootstrap.

This project helped me understand how to use the grid system and utility classes to make responsive designs faster.

The hardest part was keeping the images and spacing balanced across different screen sizes — but with more practice, I know I’ll get better at it.
